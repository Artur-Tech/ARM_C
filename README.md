# ARM_C
Testing ARM with C Language

#Project Name
This project is a simple program written in C and ARM assembler that implements the function max to find the maximum element in an integer array. The program can be compiled and executed on an ARM-based device.

#Getting Started
To get started with this project, you will need an ARM-based device with a compiler toolchain installed. You can download the toolchain from the ARM website or use a package manager to install it.

Once you have the toolchain installed, you can clone this repository and run make to compile the program. You can then run the program with make run. You can also run tests with make test.

#How it Works
The max function implemented in this program takes an integer array and its length as arguments, and returns the maximum element in the array. The function is implemented in ARM assembler for efficiency.

The program also includes a simple test suite to ensure that the max function works correctly.
